## What is TCC?

Computational Colour Constancy (CCC) consists of estimating the colour of one or more illuminants in a scene and using them to remove unwanted chromatic distortions. The Temporal Colour Constancy (TCC) task pursue the same aim but leverages the temporal information intrinsic in sequences of correlated images (e.g., the frames in a video).
